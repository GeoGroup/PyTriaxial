PyTriaxial:A Python Package for Triaxial Geomaterial Testing with Various Constitutive Models

PyTriaxial is a Python-based numerical simulation package designed for triaxial geomaterial testing. It supports linear elasticity, nonlinear elasticity, and elastoplastic models. The software adopts a modular architecture with a transparent computational process, enabling users to customize constitutive relationships and loading paths. This paper presents the core theoretical framework and validates the computational accuracy and stability through numerical experiments. The results indicate that PyTriaxial accurately simulates the mechanical response in triaxial tests, confirming its suitability for geotechnical engineering research. Future work will prioritize optimizing computational performance, extending constitutive models, and integrating deep learning to broaden applicability.
